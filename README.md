# Environment
python3.7 would be needed

# Notes
The models to be trained in "685_Cartography.ipynb" will take ~4 hours each on Colab Pro, have not checked to see if it works on normal colab.

# Instructions on how to run

1. Open "685_Cartography.ipynb" and follow the instructions.
2. Open "QNLI_Bert.ipynb" and follow the instructions.
3. Open "QNLI_Deberta.ipynb" and follow the instructions.
4. Open "MNLI_Bert.ipynb" and follow the instructions
5. Open "MNLI_Deberta.ipynb" and follow the instructions.
